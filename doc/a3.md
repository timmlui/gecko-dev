You must describe why the issue is worth resolving and thus what value your work will add to the mozilla project.
Diagnosis of your bug. Describe in English what the issue is, and what the benefit of fixing will bring. What risks are there, if any?
Diagnosis. Clearly describes the problem and what needs to be done to solve it

######Diagnosis
There is a Class Strucutre Warning in the GeckoView product of Mozilla due to redundant declarations of methods with both private and final. Private methods cannot be meaningfully overridden, so the final declaration can be removed. This fix does not affect functionality of code, but is to just clean up warning messages and rid logs of unnecessary context. The affected classes are: 
- GeckoLoader in methods -> getCPUABI, attemptLoad and doLoadLibraryExpected
- GeckoRuntime in method -> getProcessName


Testing document - A process (or description of a process) by which you’d evaluate the success of your work.  (See Note 1) How do you know your change addresses the bug?
Describe a testing procedure or manual inspection process that will show you have fixed the bug. That is, describe the behaviour or artifact  that is wrong before your patch is applied and how it should appear or behave after your patch is applied.
Test plan: Clearly articulates how to demonstrate that the problem has been fixed

######Testing
Given from the mozilla mentor's comment on helping me setup and run GeckoView. The Class Structure warnings were seen in the console log: [insert SS]. After applying my fix specified below, I re-built GeckoView and ran it again, this time without the Class Structure warnings: [insert SS].

Propose a  solution. Describe in English what you’d do, and the step by step process you’d follow. The goal is to present your reasoning to the person who would be evaluating your patch.
Fix: Appropriate technical solution of the bug, in line with any suggestions from the mentor and mozilla guidelines.

######Fix
The solution is to reduce the methods to just either private or final, since private and final are redundant modifiers. Although making these two declarations would not cause any problems, it does not accomplish anything further either, since private modifiers are automatically considered as final modifiers. Along with the mozilla mentor's comment: "As private methods cannot be meaningfully overridden, declaring them final is redundant", I removed the final modifiers from the affected methods.
