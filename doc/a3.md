######Diagnosis
There is a Class Strucutre Warning in the GeckoView product of Mozilla due to redundant declarations of methods with both private and final. Private methods cannot be meaningfully overridden, so the final declaration can be removed. This fix does not affect functionality of code, but is to just clean up warning messages and rid logs of unnecessary context. The affected classes are: 
- GeckoLoader in methods -> getCPUABI, attemptLoad and doLoadLibraryExpected
- GeckoRuntime in method -> getProcessName

###### Testing
Given from the mozilla mentor's comment on helping me setup and run GeckoView. The Class Structure warnings were seen in the console log: ![alt text](https://github.com/timmlui/gecko-dev/blob/CSC302-A3-branch/doc/warning.jpg "Class structure warning")
After applying my fix specified below, I re-built GeckoView and ran it again, this time without the Class Structure warnings.

###### Fix
The solution is to reduce the methods to just either private or final, since private and final are redundant modifiers. Although making these two declarations would not cause any problems, it does not accomplish anything further either, since private modifiers are automatically considered as final modifiers. Along with the mozilla mentor's comment: "As private methods cannot be meaningfully overridden, declaring them final is redundant", I removed the final modifiers from the affected methods.
